        <h1>MomentJS vs Date</h1>

        <h2>Now </h2>
        <p>Get the current (date)time.<br>
            Datetimes are always rendered by the browser <i>in the user's timezone</i>.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Date</b><br/>
            <code>new Date()</code>: <span id='now-date'></span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>MomentJS</b><br/>
            <code>moment()</code>: <span id='now-moment'></span>
        </p>

        <h2>Timestamps</h2>
        <p>Since we need to pass time between different timezones, time is usually passed around in UTC (Universal Time, Coordinated) time stamps.
            UTC is sometimes also referred to as Greenwich Mean Time since it's based on the local standard time in Greenwich. Midnight in Greenwich means
            00:00UTC, and noon at 12:00UTC.

            In the computing world, we also tend to pass around what we call Unix Timestamps. A Unix timestamp (also known as POSIX time) describes
            the # of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 Thursday, 1 Jan 1970 UTC.
        </p>

        <p>If the date is before 1970, then the time stamp will be negative!</p>

        <h3>Getting the current (unix) timestamp</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Date</b><br/>
            <p>Both <code>Date.now()</code> and <code>Date().getTime()</code> will get the current unix timestamp, but `Date.now()` is recommended as it is clearer and much faster.</p>
            <code>Date.now()</code>: <span id='unix-date'></span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>MomentJS</b><br/>
            <p>`unix()` returns a unix timestamp in seconds; `valueOf()` returns it in seconds</p>
            <code>moment().unix()</code>: <span id='unix-moment'></span>
            <br>
            <code>moment().valueOf()</code>: <span id='unix-moment-value-of'></span>
        </p>

        <h3>Parsing a timestamp</h3>
        <p>Given the timestamp '737424000', which represents my birthday as May 15 1993 00:00:00 UTC...</p>
        <p>
            <b>Date</b><br/>
            <code>new Date(parseInt(timestamp) * 1000)</code>: <span id='parse-timestamp-date'></span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>MomentJS</b><br/>
            <code>moment.unix(timestamp)</code>: <span id='parse-timestamp-moment'></span>
        </p>

        <p>If you're viewing this West of Greenwich, England then it'll say May 14 because I was born on May 14 in your timezone! (At least according to the timestamp, which says that I was born at 00:00:00 on May 15)</p>

        <h3>Parsing a string</h3>

        <h2>Relative Dates</h2>

        <h3>Difference between dates</h3>

        <h3>X days/months/years from now</h3>

        <h2>Formatting</h2>
        <script src='./index.js'></script>

        <h2>Extra Notes</h2>
        <p><b>Daylight savings does not affect UTC</b>; it decides the change in offset <i>to</i> UTC.</p>
        <p><b>Leap seconds</b> for UTC is kept within 0.9 seconds of physical reality by introducing a "leap second" in the last minute of the UTC year (or the last minute of June).</p>

        <p>Remember that UTC is totally arbitary!</p>
