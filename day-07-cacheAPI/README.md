# CacheAPI a.k.a. ServiceWorkers pt. II

The CacheAPI was part of the ServiceWorker spec.
It is an API for cacheing network Request and Response objects, which is very useful for offline page cacheing.

Work will be done in the [pre-existing folder for Service Workers](https://github.com/mondayrain/100-days/tree/master/day-02-service-workers), from Day 2.
